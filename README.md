## Prerequisites

1. `JDK` is needed to be on the machine since the project uses Java as programming language.
2. `maven` is needed to be installed on the machine as the project uses maven as build and dependency management tool.

## How to run the scripts

- From terminal, go to the root directory where the `pom.xml` file is present. 
- Run the following command to run the scripts in the test directory.

```
mvn test
